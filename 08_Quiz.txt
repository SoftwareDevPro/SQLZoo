 SELECT region, name, population FROM bbc x WHERE population <= ALL (SELECT population FROM bbc y WHERE y.region=x.region AND population>0)

2. Select the code that shows the countries belonging to regions with all populations over 50000

 SELECT name,region,population FROM bbc x WHERE 50000 < ALL (SELECT population FROM bbc y WHERE x.region=y.region AND y.population>0)

3. Select the code that shows the countries with a less than a third of the population of the countries around it

SELECT name, region FROM bbc x
 WHERE population < ALL (SELECT population/3 FROM bbc y WHERE y.region = x.region AND y.name != x.name)

4. Select the result that would be obtained from the following code:

SELECT name FROM bbc
 WHERE population >
       (SELECT population
          FROM bbc
         WHERE name='United Kingdom')
